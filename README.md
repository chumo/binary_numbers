# binary_numbers
A simple web app created with chatGPT to demonstrate how binary numbers work.

The app was created with chatGPT by presenting an image of the desired UI, and explaining the functionality. The AI got it almost right in the first iteration, as it just missed the way html components would have to be positioned on the screen. With a few more iterations to fine tune the styles, the app was ready.

The main purpose of this app is to demonstrate to my kids how software development looks like in the era of generative AI.

Enjoy!
